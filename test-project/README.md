2. Open `index.html` in the editor
3. Click the "Open Preview" button in the editor title bar or from the Command Palette
4. Interact with the various elements to test functionality:
   - Toggle between light and dark themes
   - Add and remove items from the list
   - Fetch mock data to test dynamic content loading
   - Resize the preview window to test responsive design
   - Check the real-time updating timer at the bottom
